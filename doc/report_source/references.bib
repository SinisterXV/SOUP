abstract="The Pentium computer chip's division algorithm relies on a table from which five entries were inadvertently omitted, with the result that 1738 single precision dividend-divisor pairs yield relative errors whose most significant bit is uniformly distributed from the 14th to the 23rd (least significant) bit. This corresponds to a rate of one error every 40 billion random single precision divisions. The same general pattern appears at double precision, with an error rate of one in every 9 billion divisions or 75 minutes of division time.",
